title: "My Journey with Node.js"
---

My journey in the Node.js project began in November 2024, when I tried to contribute to the website for the first time. I attempted to fix a small [bug](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7269), but couldn't solve it at the time because a Next.js server is too heavy for a 4GB RAM machine 🤯. However, I didn't give up and discovered I could use GitHub Codespaces to help with the website and later with other parts of the project.

## Website Team

- I joined the team on **March 27, 2025**, after contributing several times to the Node.js website - [nodejs/nodejs.org#7564](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/7564).
- I helped migrate **Tailwind CSS v3 to v4**, keeping the site updated with the latest tool versions - [nodejs/nodejs.org#7507](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7507).
- Co-creator of the **Node.js partners page**, helping create a page showcasing companies that support the Node.js project - [nodejs/nodejs.org#7991](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7991).

## Package Maintenance Team

- I joined the team on **January 10, 2025**, aiming to maintain several packages, including wiby, meet, and statusboard - [nodejs/package-maintenance#617](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/617).
- I've helped improve the team's governance, enhancing internal processes.

## Node.js Core

Over time, as a maintainer of several packages within the Node.js ecosystem, I became more interested in the Node.js core and how to help improve the project itself.

- I joined the Node.js triage team on **March 24, 2025**, helping review and classify issues and pull requests in the main Node.js repository - [nodejs/node#57564](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/57564).
- I've helped remove old features that are no longer needed in the Node.js core and have been deprecated, such as [writeHeader](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/59060) and [\_http\_\* modules](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/59293).
