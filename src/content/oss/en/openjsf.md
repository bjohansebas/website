title: "My journey with the OpenJS Foundation"
---

My journey as a contributor to the OpenJS Foundation has started since I began actively collaborating on projects like Express and Node.js, both under the OpenJS Foundation umbrella.

## Cross Project Council

- I joined the Cross Project Council (CPC) on **January 21, 2025** as a regular member - [openjs-foundation/cross-project-council#1411](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/1411)
- I've participated in discussions for governance and direction of projects under the Foundation.

## Sustainability Collaboration Space

- I collaborated with the Sustainability group to facilitate an interview with the Astro team, as part of efforts to understand how Open Source projects can improve their sustainability - [openjs-foundation/sustainability-collab-space](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/sustainability-collab-space/issues/40)
