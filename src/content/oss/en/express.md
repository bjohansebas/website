title: "My Journey with Express"
---

My journey as an Express maintainer began in August 2024, when I submitted my first pull request with an improvement to the design of the official Express website. Since then, I've been actively involved in the community, contributing bug fixes and improvements to both the documentation and packages maintained by the organization.

Throughout this path, I've taken on various roles and responsibilities within different teams, always aiming to strengthen the project, improve the user experience, and ensure Express' long-term sustainability.

This is a relatively new team, focused on maintaining and improving TypeScript types for Express and related packages. The main goal is to **integrate TypeScript types directly into Express core packages**, improving development experience and reducing dependency on external definitions.

- I'm actively involved in defining guidelines and evolving this initiative within the project.
