title: My Journey with webpack
---

My journey in webpack is just beginning, but I've already had the chance to join the security team

## Webpack Security Team

- I joined the team on **August 30, 2025**, aiming to improve the project's internal security practices - [webpack/security-wg#3](https://github.com/webpack/security-wg/pull/3).
- I've driven several key initiatives to strengthen webpack's security, including:
  - Proposal to **unify security policies** in a single file, to centralize and simplify maintenance - [webpack/security-wg#5](https://github.com/webpack/security-wg/issues/5)
