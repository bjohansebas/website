title: Sponsor my laptop!

description: "I share the context behind my open-source work, the state of my current setup, and why I’m seeking support to keep contributing without technical limitations."
---

For several years, I’ve been actively contributing to open-source projects used by millions of developers every day, such as **Express**, **Webpack**, and various tools in the **Node.js** ecosystem.

A large part of this work isn’t always visible: reviewing issues, maintaining critical dependencies, improving performance, responding to security reports, coordinating major changes, and helping projects move forward without breaking the people who depend on them.

I do this because I deeply believe in the value of open source and in the responsibility of keeping the ecosystem we use every day healthy. But to keep doing this sustainably, I need to talk about something very concrete and practical.

## The equipment I work with today

My current laptop is an [HP Notebook 14-ac186la (ENERGY STAR)](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/details/hp-14-notebook-pc-series/model/9068285).
It has **more than 10 years of use** and has been my main tool for contributing to open source throughout all this time.

With this machine, I’ve worked on releases, code reviews, performance improvements, debugging, coordination with other maintainers, and security-related tasks in large projects like Express.

However, after so many years of continuous use, the hardware is clearly reaching its limits.

## Why does this matter?

My current work includes, among other things:

- Maintaining and improving critical projects in the Node.js ecosystem.
- Reviewing and responding to issues and pull requests.
- Participating in security triage.
- Working on major changes across all the packages I maintain daily, as well as related tooling.
- Coordinating community initiatives, such as the Express website redesign.

All of this requires a stable, fast, and reliable machine. When the equipment fails, time, energy, and focus are lost, which directly impacts the pace of open-source work.

## What I’m looking for

I’m looking for support to be able to acquire a new laptop that will allow me to keep contributing consistently, in a focused and sustainable way.

The money raised through these platforms will be used exclusively for this purpose. Depending on the funds I’m able to raise over the coming months, I’ll be able to purchase a new machine that lets me maintain this pace of work without the current limitations.

As I collect the funds, I’ll keep this blog updated and share progress on social media, so anyone can see how things are going. Once I have enough money and make the purchase, I’ll publicly share the details of the equipment I’ll acquire, as part of a transparency effort with those who choose to support this goal.

A better machine would help me:

- Respond more quickly to issues, PRs, and security reports.
- Reduce friction in builds, testing, and local development.
- Maintain the same level of long-term commitment to the projects.
- Keep contributing to the ecosystem without burning out due to technical limitations.

This isn’t about luxury, but about having a work tool that matches the kind of projects I maintain.

## How can you help?

If you find the work I do valuable and want to support this goal, you can help in several ways:

## Thank you

Open source isn’t sustained by good intentions alone, it also depends on people, their time, and the tools they use to do their work.

Thanks for reading, for using open source, and for supporting this journey in any way 🙏
